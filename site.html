    <h2>The Quahog Chronicles</h2>
    <p>Alright, Lois, check this out! I finally got around to starting my own blog. It&#39;s gonna be full of my awesome thoughts, hilarious stories, and maybe a few embarrassing moments...oops!</p>
    <p>First up, I gotta tell ya about the time I ate a whole rotisserie chicken in one sitting. Meg tried to stop me, but you know how much I love meat. Anyway, it was glorious! ...Until I had to go to the bathroom, that is. Let&#39;s just say it was a wild ride.</p>

      <h1>Gourd Anthem: A Tale of Feud and Song</h1> 
      <p>In a lush valley, big, beautiful, lovely gourds gathered to sing a song of their people. It was a gourd song, filled with the stories of their ancestors and the struggles they faced. But amidst the harmony, a discordant note echoed - their hatred for little owls, whom they deemed mean and ugly.</p>

      <p>The gourds&#39; song bellowed through the hills, a chorus of disdain for the owls&#39; sharp beaks and piercing gazes. They sang of how the owls would swoop down, stealing their seeds and leaving them to wither away.</p>

         <p>A particularly large and beautiful gourd, named Gourdo, stepped forward to lead the song. His voice boomed, echoing the sentiments of his people.</p>

         <p>Meanwhile, in a nearby tree, a little owl named Hoot watched the gourds with curiosity. She wondered why they sang with such hatred in their hearts.</p>

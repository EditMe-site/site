Daddy&#39;s got a brand new blog and it&#39;s gonna be hotter than a chili cook-off in Quahog! Prepare yourself for my wit, my wisdom, and maybe a few dumb things I did... oops! Gotta run! I heard Stewie talking about taking over the world.</p><p><i>Just realized I left my pants at the Clam.  Hope Quagmire doesn&#39;t mind my borrowing them again.</i></p><p>First up, I gotta tell ya about the time I ate a whole rotisserie chicken in one sitting. Meg tried to stop me, she said it was &#39;gross,&#39; can you believe that? Anyway, it was glorious! ...Until I had to go to the bathroom. Let&#39;s just say it was a wild ride. Gotta split! Lois is calling for dinner!</p><p>Hey Lois, you know what the heck is weird? Those Dutch people! They love clogs, they love windmills, and they all talk funny. It&#39;s like they live in a different dimension, or somethin&#39;.   </p><p>So, this one time, I woke up with a craving for a Pawtucket Patriot Ale... which seemed totally justifiable considering the state of the world.</p><p> Naturally, I headed straight to the Drunken Clam, but I realized I left my wallet at home. Oh, the humanity! Anyway, Quagmire saw me looking forlorn and offered to buy me a beer. He even gave me one of those peanuts he keeps stashed in his jacket. Turns out, the peanuts were actually a little stale, but hey, it&#39;s the thought that counts, right?</p><div class="marquee"><span style="color: #EE82EE; font-family: Courier New;">Peter Griffin&#39;s Blog - All Right</span></div> </body></html>
